# Training

In this folder you can find the code for the training of the models.

Training is done through the `Trainer` class in the `trainer.py` file. This class is responsible for the training of the model and the logging of the training process. All logs generated during training are stored in the `logs` folder. This includes all possible outputs generated during training.
